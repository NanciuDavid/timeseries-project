# ARIMA Intervention Analysis of US GDP Data

## Intervention Analysis Overview
In this extension of the ARIMA analysis, we added COVID-19 intervention dummy variables to explicitly model the structural break:

- **COVID Shock**: Q1-Q2 2020 (sharp decline)
- **COVID Recovery**: Q3-Q4 2020 (rapid rebound)
- **Post-COVID**: 2021 onwards (different growth trajectory)

## Model Comparison
We compared the following models:
- ARIMA(3,1,3) - original complex model without intervention
- ARIMAX(3,1,3) - complex model with COVID intervention
- ARIMA(0,1,1) - original simple model without intervention
- ARIMAX(0,1,1) - simple model with COVID intervention

## Key Findings
1. Best model: ARIMA(0,1,1) with MAPE = 26.81%
2. The intervention coefficients were not statistically significant
3. The intervention models improved forecast accuracy during the COVID period.

## Improvement from Original ARIMA
- Original ARIMA(3,1,3): MAPE = 37.11%
- Best model: MAPE = 26.81%
- Improvement: 10.30%

## Conclusion
The intervention analysis did not significantly improve upon the original model.
